The contracts were rolled over, the problem we had was that the symbol was incorrect for the LGO TAS There was an exchange driven change for the Gas oil contract where there was a symbol root change from <GASFM> to <GFM>.During the change the symbol was not updated for the TAS RIC hence we did not get any updates Once the issue was reported we corrected the symbol and started receiving updates from today. This symbol root change does not happen often and happens very rarely. In the future for during such changes we would ensure that the TAS RIC changes are being added to our checklist Mapping to the RICS was corrected by content team. We happened to check with the ICE exchange helpdesk and taken to understand that the GAS OIL TAS contracts for February 2015 and March 2015 aren�t valid and listed. The listing is only till January 2015 and post 2015 this TAS contract would be delisted / removed and it would be listed under �LOW SULPHUR GASOIL� as the GAS OIL TAS contract is changing specs for the Feb15. Please find the below link for your reference. https://www.theice.com/products/228/Gasoil-Futures-Low-Sulphur-Gasoil-from-February-2015-TAS/data - GASOIL FUTURES (LOW SULPHUR GASOIL FROM FEBRUARY 2015) TAS Attaching the mail trail for your reference from exchange which confirms the migration to Low Sulphur Gas Oil Futures starting with Feb15 and out the curve . Furthermore, these RICs were added on our system based on the exchange reference messages earlier and would be removed from the system over the weekend housekeeping maintenance activity.
